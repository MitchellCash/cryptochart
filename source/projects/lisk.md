Lisk is a Blockchain application platform, established in early 2016. Based on its own Blockchain network and token LSK, Lisk enables developers to create, distribute and manage decentralized Blockchain applications by deploying their own sidechain linked to the Lisk network, including a custom token. Thanks to the flexibility of sidechains, developers can implement and customize their Blockchain applications entirely.
