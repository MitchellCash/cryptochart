Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and [everyone can take part](https://bitcoin.org/en/support-bitcoin). Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.
