Ripple is a network of computers which use the [Ripple consensus algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1QVb1vlC0) to atomically settle and record transactions on a secure distributed database, the Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL). Because of its distributed nature, the RCL offers transaction immutability without a central operator. The RCL contains a built-in currency exchange and its path-finding algorithm finds competitive exchange rates across order books and currency pairs.
