Dogecoin is a fun, new and rapidly growing form of digital currency.
This form of digital currency is called "cryptocurrency"; a type of digital currency.
Cryptocurrency is completely anonymous, decentralized, and extremely secure.

Dogecoin is used with a wallet on your computer, your smartphone, or a website.
You can use it to buy goods and services, or trade it for other currencies (both other cryptocurrencies or traditional currency like US dollars).

One of the most popular uses for Dogecoin is "tipping" fellow internet-goers who create or share great content. Think of it as a more meaningful "like" or upvote, with real value that can be used all across the internet.
