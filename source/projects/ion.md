ION is a blockchain based decentralized cryptocurrency that rewards network participation via static proof of stake by rewarding “connectivity age” instead of “coin age”. By having a static reward system, the rewards for participation are proportional to the work every active node contributes. This discourages centralization and promotes network health. In addition to static rewards, ION implements a masternode network to incentivize large holders, and perform advanced functions such as near instant and private transactions.

The long term vision for ION is a thriving cryptocurrency ecosystem centered on gaming and digital goods.
