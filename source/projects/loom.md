Loom Network DAppChains are built for Games and Social Apps. Token-based karma, Ethereum-based crypto-collectibles, all based on forkable, decentralized, and human-readable blockchain rulesets. 

DAppChains are full-featured blockchains that are built to run in parallel to Ethereum Smart Contracts. Theyâ€™re an advanced form of Ethereum sidechains optimized for scaling data rather than financial transactions.

Every DApp runs on its own sidechain, meaning its data is public and forkable, just like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
