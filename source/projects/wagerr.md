Wagerr is a decentralized sportsbook that brings trustless sportsbetting to the entire world. Due to its strict use of Application Specific Smart Contracts (ASSC) and 2nd layer network controlled by Oracle Masternodes, Wagerr solves the security, scaling and incentive issues that have plagued smart contracts since their inception. Additionally, Wagerr combines leaps in technical design with an economic linkage that creates a deflationary, and self regulating economy. Through decentralized governance and contract fees, structural mechanisms balance Wagerrâ€™s token value by dynamically adjusting supply based on the current exchange rate and betting volume within the Wagerr network.

Wagerr does this all while avoiding single points of failure and implementing a network and system that is fully decentralized.
