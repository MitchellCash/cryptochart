# The Rules

Everybody is welcome to contribute to CryptoChart, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mitchellcash/cryptochart) and send a pull request.
Each cryptocurrency is a markdown file in the `source/projects` directory.

We'll only accept pull requests adding new cryptocurrencies if they follow the following rules:

*   **Open Source:** The cryptocurrency must be released under an open source license.
*   **Accessible on GitHub:** The generator must have a public repository on GitHub that we can link to and pull in stats from.
*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other cryptocurrencies in `source/projects`.
